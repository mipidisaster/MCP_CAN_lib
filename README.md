# MCP_CAN Library for Arduino
ROS package library for MCP2515 module (CAN bus interface) through the use of SPI ROS services (milibrary construct)

Forked from [MCP_CAN](https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib) library.

The MCP2515 module is a SPI-CAN interface. The MCP_CAN_ROS library is making use of SPI ROS services which are generated as part of the milibrary repository. Therefore the original library has been modified so as to make use of this.
